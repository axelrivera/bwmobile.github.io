# Better Workouts Privacy Policy

Effective Date: May 5th, 2021

Better Workouts does not require any form of registration or the creation of a personal user account to use it. You can use Better Workouts anonymously without having to provide a name, username or e-mail address.

## Payment Data

The App uses [RevenueCat](https://revenuecat.com/) to manage in-app purchases. RevenueCat's Privacy Policy can be [found here](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

## Apple Health Data

Better Workouts will also ask for your explicit permission to access specific categories of health data that are stored on your device through Apple Health. If you permit Better Workouts to access those categories of data, then Better Workouts will process that data to process your workout metrics.

Any data processing of your health data will take place exclusively on the devices that you use to run Better Workouts. Better Workouts will not transmit your health data that it will access from Apple Health to external servers either owned by Rivera Labs LLC or any other third party. We will not sell your Health Data to advertising platforms, affiliate networks, data brokers or information resellers. We will not use your Health Data for advertising, promotion, cross-selling or any similar service.

Rivera Labs LLC may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or get your consent as required by law. We will not change this agreement to allow the collection of your Health Data or make other significant changes without your consent.
